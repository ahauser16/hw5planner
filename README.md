It took longer to complete the assignment.  Without knowing how to organize writing my code on screen I was just as lost organizing it in my head.  My pseudo code often missed important steps that cost me time because I wouldn't know what the next step was.  It's hard to extrapolate the inner workings of a website from a .gif.  Also, even though I believe my submitted hw satisfiest the requirements it would take a lot more work to make it fully functional.  It's hard to know how far down the rabbit hole you should go for an assignment.
